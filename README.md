The goal of this class is to introduce biomedical scientists to data
analysis with Python notebooks. There are two parts to the session: a
lecture on the key issues in data analysis and a hands-on tutorial.
Please prepare for class as follows:

1.  Read the
    [Introduction](https://github.com/sangyu/moda/blob/main/nbs/01_Introduction.ipynb)
    and install the prerequisite software on your laptop.
2.  Go through a [Quick Tour of the
    Notebook](https://github.com/sangyu/moda/blob/main/nbs/02_Quick_tour_of_the_Notebook.ipynb)
    to familiarise yoruself to the jupyter notebook environment.
3.  Bring your laptop to class, and we will go through the examples in
    [Data Analysis with
    Jupyter](http://localhost:8890/notebooks/nbs/03_Data_Analysis_with_Jupyter.ipynb)

If we have more time in class, you will also be introduced to our
estimation statistics package [DABEST
Introduction](https://github.com/sangyu/moda/blob/main/nbs/04_Dabest_introduction.ipynb).
